#According to the data, most of elon musk's tweets contain a high load of subjectivity, which in turn could be related to polarity. That is, a slight relationship has been found between both variables, so that the greater the subjectivity, the greater the polarity (more positive sentiment).


#Another discovery was the close relationship between the likes and retweets variables. According to the correlation matrix, when the number of likes increases, so would the number of retweets, and vice versa. However, it is important to remember that this does not imply any causality between the variables.


#On the other hand, the number of likes in the tweets seems to have no relationship with the sentiment variable, since in addition to the low degree of correlation, it was found that over the year the number of likes did not vary greatly depending on the type of sentiment found in the text.
